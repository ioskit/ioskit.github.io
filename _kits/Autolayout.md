*Auto Layout* is a system that lets you lay out your app’s user interface by creating a mathematical description of the relationships between the elements. You define these relationships in terms of constraints either on individual elements, or between sets of elements. Using *Auto Layout*, you can create a dynamic and versatile interface that responds appropriately to changes in screen size, device orientation, and localization.

*Auto Layout* is built into Interface Builder in Xcode 5, and is available to apps targeted at either iOS and OS X. *Auto Layout* is enabled by default when you create a new project.
