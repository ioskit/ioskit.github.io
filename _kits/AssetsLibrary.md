The *Assets Library* framework (`AssetsLibrary.framework`) provides access to the photos and videos managed by the Photos app on a user’s device. Use this framework to access items in the user’s saved photos album or in any albums imported onto the device. You can also save new photos and videos back to the user’s saved photos album.
