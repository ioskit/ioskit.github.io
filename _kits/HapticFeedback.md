TODO

On supported devices, haptics provide a way to physically engage users with tactile feedback that gets attention and reinforces actions. 
Some system-provided interface elements, such as pickers, switches, and sliders, automatically provide haptic feedback as users interact with them. 
Your app can also ask the system to generate different types of haptic feedback. iOS manages the strength and behavior of this feedback.
