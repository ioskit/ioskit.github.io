*Text Kit* is a full-featured set of [UIKit](/UIKit) classes for managing text and fine typography. Text Kit can lay out styled text into paragraphs, columns, and pages; it easily flows text around arbitrary regions such as graphics; and it manages multiple fonts. Text Kit is integrated with all [UIKit](/UIKit) text-based controls to enable apps to create, edit, display, and store text more easilyâ€”and with less code than was previously possible in iOS.
