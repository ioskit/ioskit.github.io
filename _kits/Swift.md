Swift is an innovative new programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Writing code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast. Swift is ready for your next iOS and OS X project — or for addition into your current app — because Swift code works side-by-side with Objective-C.

## Features

* Design
  * Closures unified with function pointers
  * Tuples and multiple return values
  * Generics
  * Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection
  * Structs that support methods, extensions, protocols.
  * Functional programming patterns, e.g.: map and filter
  * Types: `class`, `protocole`, `extension` and `enum`
  * Operators: Equality (`==`, value) and Identity (`===`, reference)
  * `typealias` (typealias AudioSample = UInt16; var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min)
  * There is no Exception
* Optionals (Optional Binding, Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals)
* REPL
