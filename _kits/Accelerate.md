The *Accelerate framework* (`Accelerate.framework`) contains interfaces for performing digital signal processing (DSP), linear algebra, and image-processing calculations. The advantage of using this framework over writing your own versions of these interfaces is that they are optimized for all of the hardware configurations present in iOS devices. Therefore, you can write your code once and be assured that it runs efficiently on all devices.
