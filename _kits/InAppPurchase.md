In-App Purchase gives you the flexibility to support a variety of business models in your iOS and OS X apps. With In-App Purchase, you can offer your customers additional digital content, functionality, services and even subscriptions within your paid or free app.

For example, In-App Purchase will allow you to sell:

* Digital books or photos
* Additional game levels
* Access to a turn-by-turn map service
* Subscriptions to digital magazines or newsletters
* Digital content hosted on Apple servers

In-App Purchase is implemented in your app via the Store Kit framework. Store Kit provides the functionality to process payments for items offered in your app via the App Store and Mac App Store. In-App Purchase uses the same business terms used for apps sold on the App Store and Mac App Store. You receive 70% of the purchase price of each item you sell within your app, paid to you on a monthly basisâ€”no credit card fees apply.
