Core Audio is a family of frameworks that provides native support for handling audio. These frameworks support the generation, recording, mixing, and playing of audio in your apps. You can also use these interfaces to work with MIDI content and to stream audio and MIDI content to other apps.

### The framework

The *Core MIDI* framework (`CoreMIDI.framework`) Provides a standard way to communicate with MIDI devices, including hardware keyboards and synthesizers. You use this framework to send and receive MIDI messages and to interact with MIDI peripherals connected to an iOS-based device using the dock connector or network.

Connect from an iOS device using the dock connector or a network. For more information about using the dock connector, see [Appleâ€™s MFi program](http://developer.apple.com/programs/mfi/).
