The *Image I/O* framework (`ImageIO.framework`) provides interfaces for importing and exporting image data and image metadata. This framework makes use of the [Core Graphics](/CoreGraphics) data types and functions and supports all of the standard image types available in iOS. You can also use this framework to access Exif and IPTC metadata properties for images.
