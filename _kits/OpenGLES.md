The **OpenGL ES** framework (`OpenGLES.framework`) provides tools for drawing 2D and 3D content. It is a C-based framework that works closely with the device hardware to provide fine-grained graphics control and high frame rates for full-screen immersive apps such as games. You use the OpenGL framework in conjunction with the EAGL interfaces, which provide the interface between your OpenGL ES drawing calls and the native window objects in UIKit.

The framework supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0. The 2.0 specification added support for fragment and vertex shaders and the 3.0 specification added support for many more features, including multiple render targets and transform feedback.
