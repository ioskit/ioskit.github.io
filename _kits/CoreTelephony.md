The **Core Telephony** framework (`CoreTelephony.framework`) provides interfaces for interacting with phone-based information on devices that have a cellular radio. Apps can use this framework to get information about a userâ€™s cellular service provider. Apps interested in cellular call events (such as VoIP apps) can also be notified when those events occur.
