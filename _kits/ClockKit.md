This new framework enables apps to provide up-to-date and meaningful information that updates throughout the day directly on the clock face with Complications. And with the new Time Travel feature in watchOS 2, users can turn the Digital Crown to go backward and forward in time to display information in Complications from that time. Users can even enable multiple versions of your app's Complications on the same clock face to display a variety of information.
