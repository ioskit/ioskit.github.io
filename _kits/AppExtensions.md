iOS 8 introduces a new concept called App Extensions: a way for you to share your app’s functionality with other apps, with to the OS itself.

One of these types of extensions are Today Extensions, also known as Widgets. These allow you to present information in the [NotificationCenter](/NotificationCenter), which can be a great way to provide immediate and up-to-date information that the user is interested in.
