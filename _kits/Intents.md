The Intents framework (`Intents.framework`) supports the handling of [SiriKit](/SiriKit) interactions. You use the classes of this framework to define an Intents extension, which is an app extension that processes user requests originating from Siri or Maps. When the user requests your app services through one of these conduits, the system forwards those requests to your Intents extension for handling. You use the classes of this framework to receive the data from the user and to provide an appropriate response.

For information about how to use this framework to implement an Intents extension, see [SiriKit Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Intents/Conceptual/SiriIntegrationGuide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016875).
