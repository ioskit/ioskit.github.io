The *PushKit* framework (`PushKit.framework`) provides registration support for VoIP apps. This framework replaces the previous APIs for registering VoIP apps. Instead of keeping a persistent connection open, and thus draining the deviceâ€™s battery, an app can use this framework to receive push notifications when there is an incoming call.
