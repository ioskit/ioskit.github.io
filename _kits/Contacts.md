[iOS 9](/iOS9) introduces the **Contacts** and [Contacts UI](/ContactsUI) frameworks (`Contacts.framework` and `ContactsUI.framework`), 
which provide modern object-oriented replacements for the [Address Book](/AddressBook) and [Address Book UI](/AddressBookUI) frameworks.

The Contacts framework provides [Swift](/Swift) and [Objective-C](/ObjectiveC) API to access the userâ€™s contact information. Because most apps 
read contact information without making any changes, this framework is optimized for thread-safe, read-only usage.
