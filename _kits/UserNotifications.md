[iOS 10](/iOS10) introduces the User Notifications framework (`UserNotifications.framework`), which supports the delivery and handling of local 
and remote notifications. You use the classes of this framework to schedule the delivery of local notifications based on specific conditions, 
such as time or location. Apps and [App Extensions](/AppExtensions) can use this framework to receive and potentially modify local and remote 
notifications when they are delivered to the userâ€™s device.

Also introduced in [iOS 10](/iOS10), the [User Notifications UI](/UserNotificationsUI) framework (UserNotificationsUI.framework).
