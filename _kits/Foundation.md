### iOS 7

The Foundation framework (Foundation.framework) includes the following enhancements:

* The NSData class adds support for Base64 encoding.
* The NSURLSession class is a new class for managing the acquisition of network-based resources. (You can use it to download content even when your app is suspended or not running.) This class serves as a replacement for the NSURLConnection class and its delegate; it also replaces the NSURLDownload class and its delegate.
* The NSURLComponents class is a new class for parsing the components of a URL. This class supports the URI standard (rfc3986/STD66) for parsing URLs.
* The NSNetService and NSNetServiceBrowser classes support peer-to-peer discovery over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
* The NSURLCredential and NSURLCredentialStorage classes let you create credentials with a synchronizable policy, and they provide the option of removing credentials with a synchronizable policy from iCloud.
* The NSURLCache, NSURLCredentialStorage, and NSHTTPCookieStorage classes now support the asynchronous processing of storage requests.
* The NSCalendar class supports new calendar types.
* The NSProgress class provides a general-purpose way to monitor the progress of an operation and report that progress to other parts of your app that want to use it.
