Xcode 6 introduces a radically new way to design and build software. [Swift](/Swift) is an innovative new programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch and, when combined with Xcode tools, makes programming a delightfully live experience. This same live experience permeates throughout Xcode 6. Live rendering within Interface Builder displays your hand-written UI code within the design canvas, instantly reflecting changes you type in code. And the new view debugger explodes all the UI layers into a 3D visualization, making it easy to understand how your interface is composed, and identify overlapping or clipping views.
