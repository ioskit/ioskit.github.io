Instance methods are methods that are called on an instance of a particular type. You can also define methods that are called on the type itself. These kinds of methods are called type methods.

Type methods are like [Class Methods in Objective-C](/ClassMethod).

To define a Type method you have to use the `class` selector:

{% gist addac16a79d100bdb6f0 %}

<!--
<pre>
  <code class="swift">class SomeClass {
  
     class func someTypeMethod() {
        // type method implementation goes here
     }
  
  }</code>
</pre>

Then you can call the method like that:

<pre>
  <code class="swift">SomeClass.someTypeMethod()</code>
</pre>
