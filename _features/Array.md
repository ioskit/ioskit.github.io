# Swift

Create arrays and dictionaries using brackets (`[]`), and access their elements by writing the index or key in brackets.

<pre><code>var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips", "blue paint"]
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"
 
var occupations = [
    "Malcolm": "Captain",
    "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
</code></pre>

To create an empty array or dictionary, use the initializer syntax.

<pre><code>let emptyArray = [String]()
let emptyDictionary = [String: Float]()
</code></pre>

If type information can be inferred, you can write an empty array as [] and an empty dictionary as [:]â€”for example, when you set a new value for a variable or pass an argument to a function.

<pre><code>shoppingList = []
occupations = [:]
</code></pre>
