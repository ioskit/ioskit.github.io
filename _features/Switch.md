A switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It then executes an appropriate block of code, based on the first pattern that matches successfully. A switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement for responding to multiple potential states.

<pre><code>let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e":
case "i", "o", "u":
    println("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
"n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    println("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    println("\(someCharacter) is not a vowel or a consonant")
}
// prints "e is a vowel"
</code></pre>
