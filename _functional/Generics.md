[Swift](/Swift) is a [type-safe language](/functional/TypeSafety). Whenever we work with types, we need to specify them. For instance, a function can have 
specific parameters and return types. This means that we cannot change the type of a constant, variable, or expression once we define it. 

Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define. 
You can write code that avoids duplication and expresses its intent in a clear, abstracted manner.
