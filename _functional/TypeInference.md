[Swift](/Swift) provides __type inference__. It infers the type of a variable, constant, or expression automatically so we do not need to specify 
the types while defining them. It implies that this language supports [Type Safety](/functional/TypeSafety).

Let's examine the following expressions.

```
let pi = 3.14159
var primeNumber = 691
let name = "my name"
```

See [Swift's Type](/Type) page for more details.
