abstract: "With a type safe language we cannot change the type of a constant, variable, or expression once we define it."

[Swift](/Swift) is a __type safe__ language. This means that we cannot change the type of a constant, variable, or expression once we define it. 
Also, the type safe nature of [Swift](/Swift) empowers us to find type mismatches during compile time.

```
var aString :String = "text"
aString = 123 // Failed
```

See [Type Safety](/functional/TypeSafety) feature.

See [Swift's Type](/Type) page for more details.
